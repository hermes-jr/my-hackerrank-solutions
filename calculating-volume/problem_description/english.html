<html></body><div class='msB'><p><strong></strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>You are given a class <em>Solution</em> and its <em>main</em> method in the editor. In each test cases, it takes an input $ch$ which represents a choice of the following:  </p>

<li>$ch=2$ represents the volume of a cuboid that has to be calculated where $l, b, h$ represent the dimensions of a cuboid.  </li>
<li>$ch=3$ represents the volume of a hemisphere that has to be calculated where $r$ represents the radius of a hemisphere.  </li>
<li>$ch=4$ represents the volume of a cylinder that has to be calculated where $r,h$ represent the radius and height of the cylinder respectively.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your task is to create the class <em>Calculate</em> and the required methods so that the code prints the volume of the figures rounded to exactly $3$ decimal places.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> <br>
There are two test cases. In the first test case $ch=1$, means you have to calculate the volume of a cube. The next line contains the $a$=4, means the side of the cube is $4$. So the volume of the cube is $64.000$. <br>
In the second test case, you have to calculate volume of a cylinder. But the height of the cylinder is negative, so an exception is thrown.</p>
