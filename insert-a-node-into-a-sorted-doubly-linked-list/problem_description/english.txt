You’re given the pointer to the head node of a sorted doubly linked list and an integer to insert into the list. The data in the nodes of the list are in ascending order. Create a node and insert it into the appropriate position in the list. The head node might be NULL to indicate that the list is empty.

**Input Format**  
You have to complete the <code>Node* SortedInsert(Node* head, int data)</code> method which takes two arguments - the head of the sorted, doubly linked list and the value to insert. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

**Output Format**  
Create a node with the given data and insert it into the given list, making sure that the new list is also sorted. Then <code>return</code> the head node of the updated list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.


**Sample Input**  

NULL , data = 2  
NULL <-- 2 <--> 4 <--> 6 --> NULL  , data = 5
    

**Sample Output**

    NULL <-- 2 --> NULL
    NULL <-- 2 <--> 4 <--> 5 <--> 6 --> NULL
    
**Explanation**  
1. We have an empty list, 2 is inserted.  
2. Data 5 is inserted such as list remains sorted.
