In this challenge, we practice solving problems based on the <em>Central Limit Theorem</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
The number of tickets purchased by each student for the <em>University X vs. University Y</em> football game follows a distribution that has a mean of $µ = 2.4$ and a standard deviation of $σ = 2.0$. </p>

<p>Suppose that a few hours before the game starts, there are $100$ eager students standing in line to purchase tickets. If there are only $250$ tickets left, what is the probability that all $100$ students will be able to purchase the tickets they want?</p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>Your output must be a floating point/decimal number, correct to a scale of $4$ decimal places. You can submit solutions in either of the $2$ following ways:   </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Solve the problem manually and submit your result as <em>Plain Text</em>. In the text box below, enter a single floating point/decimal number.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit an <em>R</em> or <em>Python</em> program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded), and computes the answer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>

<pre><code>0.1234
</code></pre>

<p>(This is <strong>NOT</strong> the answer, just a demonstration of the answering format.)   </p></div></body></html>
