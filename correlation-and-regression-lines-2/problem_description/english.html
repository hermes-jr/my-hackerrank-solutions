In this challenge, we practice calculating the slope of regression lines.</p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
There are $2$ series of data involving index numbers: $P$ for price index and $S$ for the commodity stock. <br>
 The mean and standard deviation of $P$ are $100$ and $8$, respectively.<br> 
 The mean and standard deviation of $S$ are $103$ and $4$, respectively. <br>
 The $R^2$ correlation coefficient between the two series is $0.4$. </p>

<p>With this data, obtain the <em>slope</em> of the regression line of $P$ on $S$, correct to a scale of $2$ decimal places.  </p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>Your answer should be a single floating point/decimal number, correct to a scale of $2$ decimal places. You can submit solutions in either of the $2$ following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Solve the problem manually and submit your result as <em>Plain Text</em>. In the text box below, enter a single floating point/decimal number.</li>
<li>Submit an <em>R</em> or <em>Python</em> program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded), then computes and prints the score.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your answer should follow the format below, and must not contain any extra white space or newline characters:</p>
