The price of each chocolate is $ \$C  $. The store offers a discount: for every $M$ wrappers he gives to the store, he gets one chocolate for free. How many chocolates does Bob get to eat?</p>

<p><strong>Input Format:</strong> <br>
The first line contains the number of test cases, $T$. <br>
$T$ lines follow, each of which contains three integers, $N$, $C$, and $M$. </p>

<p><strong>Output Format:</strong> <br>
Print the total number of chocolates Bob eats.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong> <br>
$1 \le T \le 1000$ <br>
$2 \le N \le 10^5$ <br>
$1 \le C \le N$ <br>
$2 \le M \le N$  </p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> <br>
In the first case, he can buy <em>5</em> chocolates with <em>\$10</em> and exchange the <em>5</em> wrappers to get one more chocolate. Thus, the total number of chocolates is <em>6</em>.</p>

<p>In the second case, he can buy <em>3</em> chocolates for <em>\$12</em>. However, it takes <em>4</em> wrappers to get one more chocolate. He can't avail the offer and hence the total number of chocolates remains <em>3</em>.  </p>

<p>In the third case, he can buy <em>3</em> chocolates for <em>\$6</em>. Now he can exchange <em>2</em> of the <em>3</em> wrappers and get <em>1</em> additional piece of chocolate. Now he can use his <em>1</em> unused wrapper and the <em>1</em> wrapper of the new piece of chocolate to get one more piece of chocolate. So the total is <em>5</em>.</p></div></body></html>
