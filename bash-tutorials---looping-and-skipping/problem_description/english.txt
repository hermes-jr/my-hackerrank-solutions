For loops in Bash can be used in several ways:  
  - iterating between two integers **a** and **b**  
  - iterating between two integer **a** and **b** and incrementing by **c**   each time  
  - iterating through the elements of an array, etc.    


Your task is to use for loops to display only **odd** natural numbers 1 to 99.

A quick but useful tutorial for bash newcomers is [here](http://www.panix.com/~elflord/unix/bash-tute.html).  
Handling input is documented and explained quite well on [this page](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_08_02.html).  
Different ways in which for loops may be used are explained with examples [here](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-for-loop/).
