Write a bash script which does just one thing: saying "HELLO".  

**Input Format**  
There is no input file required for this problem.    

**Output Format**  
HELLO  

**Sample Output**  
HELLO  

**A quick introduction to 'Echo'**    
This is the equivalent of common output commands in most programming language (print or puts statements).  

*For Example:*  

    echo "Greetings"

This outputs just one word "Greetings" (without the quotation marks).  


 <pre>echo "Greetings $USER, your current working directory is $PWD"</pre>

This picks up the values of the environment variables  $ \$ USER $ and 
$ \$ PWD $ and displays something like:  

    Greetings prashantb1984, your current working directory is /home/prashantb1984  
    
The above message, of course, will vary from system to system, depending on the setting of environment variables.
