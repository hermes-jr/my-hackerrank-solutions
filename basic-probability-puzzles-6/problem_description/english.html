In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
Bag $X$ contains $5$ <em>white</em> balls and $4$ <em>black</em> balls. Bag $Y$ contains $7$ <em>white</em> balls and $6$ <em>black</em> balls. You draw $1$ ball from bag $X$ and, without observing its color, put it into bag $Y$. Now, if a ball is drawn from bag $Y$, find the probability that it is <em>black</em>.</p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>In the editor below, submit your answer as <em>Plain Text</em> in the form of an irreducible fraction $A/B$, where $A$ and $B$ are both integers. </p>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>

<pre><code>3/4  
</code></pre>

<p>(This is <strong>NOT</strong> the answer, just a demonstration of the answer format.)</p></div></body></html>
