<html></body><div class='msB'><p><strong></strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>A large group of students took a test in physics and the final grades have a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10. If we can approximate the distribution of these grades by a normal distribution, what percent of the students </p>

<p>a) scored higher than 80? </p>

<p>b) should pass the test (gradesâ‰¥60)? </p>

<p>c) should fail the test (grades&lt;60)?</p>

<p><strong>Submission Modes and Output Format</strong></p>

<p>You may submit either an R or Python program to accomplish the above task or solve the problem on pen-and-paper. Your output should be three floating point/decimal numbers separated by a line, correct to 2 places of decimal.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the text box below, enter three floating point/decimal numbers, correct to 2 places of decimal.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you may submit an R program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded) and computes the answer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>

<pre>
65.12
15.45
2.78
</pre>

<p>(This is <strong>NOT</strong> the answer, just a demonstration of what the answering format should resemble).</p></div></body></html>
