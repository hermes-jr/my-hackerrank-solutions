<p><strong>Submission Modes and Output Format</strong></p>

<p>You may submit either an R or Python program to accomplish the above task, or solve the problem on pen-and-paper. Your output should be two floating point/decimal numbers separated by a line, correct to 3 places of decimal.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the text box below, enter two floating point/decimal numbers, correct to 3 places of decimal.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you may submit an R program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded) and computes the answer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>

<pre>
0.123
0.456
</pre>

<p>(This is <strong>NOT</strong> the answer, just a demonstration of what the answering format should resemble).</p></div></body></html>
