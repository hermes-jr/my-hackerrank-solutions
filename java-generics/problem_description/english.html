<p>Let's say you have an integer array and a string array. You have to write a <strong>single</strong> method <em>printArray</em> that can print all the elements of both arrays. The method should be able to accept both integer arrays or string arrays.</p>

<p>You are given code in the editor. Complete the code so that it prints the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
Hello
World
</code></pre>

<p>Do not use method overloading because your answer will not be accepted.</p></div></body></html>
