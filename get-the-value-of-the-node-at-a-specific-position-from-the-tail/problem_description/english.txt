Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and a specific position. Counting backwards from the tail node of the linked list, get the value of the node at the given position. A position of 0 corresponds to the tail, 1 corresponds to the node before the tail and so on.

**Input Format**  
You have to complete the <code>int GetNode(Node* head, int positionFromTail)</code> method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node from the tail. positionFromTail will be at least 0 and less than the number of nodes in the list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

**Output Format**  
Find the node at the given position counting backwards from the tail. Then <code>return</code> the <code>data</code> contained in this node. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

**Sample Input**  

    1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL, positionFromTail = 0
    1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL, positionFromTail = 2

**Sample Output**

    6
    3
