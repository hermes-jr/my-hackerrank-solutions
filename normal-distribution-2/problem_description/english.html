In this challenge, we practice solving problems with normally distributed variables.</p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
In a certain plant, the time taken to assemble a car is a random variable having a normal distribution with a mean of $20$ hours and a standard deviation of $2$ hours. What is the probability that a car can be assembled at this plant in:</p>

<ol>
<li>Less than $19.5$ hours? </li>
<li>Between $20$ and $22$ hours?</li>
</ol></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>Your output must be a floating point/decimal number, correct to a scale of $3$ decimal places. You can submit solutions in either of the $2$ following ways:   </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Solve the problem manually and submit your result as <em>Plain Text</em>. In the text box below, enter $2$ lines of floating point/decimal numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit an <em>R</em> or <em>Python</em> program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded), and computes the answer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>

<pre><code>0.123
0.456
