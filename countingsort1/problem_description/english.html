Quicksort usually has a running time of $n \times log(n)$, but is there an algorithm that can sort even faster? In general, this is not possible. Most sorting algorithms are <em>comparison sorts</em>, i.e. they sort a list just by comparing the elements to one another. A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat $n \times log(n)$ (worst-case) running time, since $n \times log(n)$ represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element. For more details, you can see <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect0913.pdf">these notes</a> (PDF). </p>

<p><strong>Alternative Sorting</strong> <br>
However, for certain types of input, it is more efficient to use a non-comparison sorting algorithm. This will make it possible to sort lists even in linear time. These challenges will cover <em>Counting Sort</em>, a fast way to sort lists where the elements have a small number of possible values, such as integers within a certain range. We will start with an easy task - counting.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> <br>
Given a list of integers, can you count and output the number of times each value appears?</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: There is no need to sort the data, you just need to count it.</p>

<p><strong>Input Format</strong> <br>
There will be two lines of input:</p>

<ul>
<li>$n$ - the size of the list</li>
<li>$ar$ - $n$ space-separated numbers that make up the list</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output Format</strong> <br>
Output the number of times every number from $0$ to $99$ (inclusive) appears on the list.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong> <br>
$100 \le n \le 10$<sup>$6$</sup> <br>
$0 \le x \lt 100, x âˆˆ ar$ </p>

<p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p>

<pre>
0 2 0 2 0 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 2 0 1 0 1 2 1 1 1 3 0 2 0 0 2 0 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 2 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 3 2 0 0 2 1 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 0 3 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 2 2 
</pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

<p>The output states that <code>0</code> appears 0 times, <code>1</code> appears 2 times, <code>2</code> appears 0 times, and so on in the given input array.</p></div></body></html>
