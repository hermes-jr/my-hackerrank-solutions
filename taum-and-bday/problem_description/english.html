There are two types of gifts that Diksha wants from Taum: one is black and the other is white. To make her happy, Taum has to buy $B$ number of black gifts and $W$ number of white gifts. </p>

<ul>
<li>The cost  of each black gift is $X$ units.  </li>
<li>The cost of every white gift is $Y$ units.  </li>
<li>The cost of converting each black gift into white gift or vice versa is $Z$ units.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Help Taum by deducing the minimum amount he needs to spend on Diksha's gifts.</p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Input Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>The first line will contain an integer $T$ which will be the number of test cases.<br>
There will be $T$ pairs of lines. The first line of each test case will contain the values of integers $B$ and $W$. Another line of each test case will contain the values of integers $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.</p>

</code></pre></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Explanation</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><ul>
<li><p><em>Sample Case #01:</em> <br>
There is no benefit to converting the white gifts into black or the black gifts into white, so Taum will have to buy each gift for <em>1</em> unit.  So cost of buying all gifts will be: $10*1 + 10*1 = 20$.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>Sample Case #02:</em> <br>
Again, we can't decrease the cost of black or white gifts by converting colors. We will buy gifts at their original price. So cost of buying all gifts will be: $5*2 + 9*3 = 10+27 = 37$. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Sample Case #03:</em> <br>
We will buy white gifts at their original price, $1$. For black gifts, we will first buy white one and color them to black, so that their cost will be reduced to $1+1=2$.  So cost of buying all gifts will be: $3*2 + 6*1 = 12$.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sample Case #04:</em> <br>
Similarly, we will buy white gifts at their original price, $2$. For black gifts, we will first buy white one and color them to black, so that their cost will be reduced to $2+1=3$. So cost of buying all gifts will be: $7*3 + 7*2 = 35$.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sample Case #05:</em> 
We will buy black gifts at their original price, $1$. For white gifts, we will first black gifts worth $1$ unit and color them to white with another $2$ units, so cost for white gifts is reduced to $3$ units. So cost of buying all gifts will be: $3*1 + 3*3 = 3+9 = 12$.</p></li>
