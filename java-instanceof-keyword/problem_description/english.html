<p>In this problem we have given you three classes in the editor, <em>Student</em>, <em>Rockstar</em> and <em>Hacker</em>. In the main function we populated an <em>ArrayList</em> with instances of these classes. <em>count</em> method counts how many instance of each type are present in the ArrayList. Some lines of the code are missing, and you have to fix it by modifying only $3$ lines!  </p>
