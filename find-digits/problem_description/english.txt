**Problem Statement**  
You are given a number _N_, you need to print the number of positions where digits exactly divides _N_.  

**Input format**

The first line contains T (number of test cases) followed by T lines (each containing N).  

**Constraints**  
1 <=T <= 15  
0 < N < 10<sup>10</sup>

**Output Format**  
For each test case print the number of positions in _N_ where digits in that number exactly divides the number _N_ in separate line. 

**Note**

Same digits repeated twice, should be counted twice.  

**Input**  

    1  
    12

**Output**  
    
    2

**Explanation**  
2 digits in the number 12 divide the number exactly. Digits at ten's place, _1_, divides 12 exactly in 12 parts, and digit at one's place, _2_ divides 12 equally in 6 parts.
