Write a bash script which accepts as input, a name, and displays a greeting:
"Welcome (name)"


**Input Format**  
One line, containing a name    


**Output Format**   
One line: "Welcome (name)" (quotation marks excluded)  
The evaluation will be case sensitive.

**Sample Input 0**  

    Dan  
    
**Sample Output 0**  

    Welcome Dan  
    
**Sample Input 1**  

    Prashant

**Sample Output 1**  

    Welcome Prashant


**A quick introduction to 'Echo'**  

This is the equivalent of common output commands in most programming language (print or puts statements).  

*For Example:*  

    echo "Greetings"

This outputs just one word "Greetings" (without the quotation marks).  


    echo "Greetings $USER, your current working directory is $PWD"

This picks up the values of the environment variables $USER$ and $PWD$ and displays something like:  

    Greetings prashantb1984, your current working directory is /home/prashantb1984  
    
The above message, of course, will vary from system to system, depending on the setting of environment variables.

**Accepting Inputs**  

This can be accomplished using the 'read' statement. 

   
    read number
    echo "The number you have entered is $number"  
   

If the user provides an input "4" (quotation marks excluded), the output is:  
    
    The number you have entered is 4  

Consider this snippet:  

    read name
    echo "The name you have entered is $name"  
   
If the user provides an input "Max" (quotation marks excluded), the output is:  
    The name you have entered is Max

A quick but useful tutorial for bash newcomers is [here](http://www.panix.com/~elflord/unix/bash-tute.html).  
Handling input is documented and explained quite well on [this page](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_08_02.html).
