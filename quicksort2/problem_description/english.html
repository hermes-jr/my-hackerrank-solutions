<html></body><div class='msB'><p><strong></strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>In the previous challenge, you wrote a <em>partition</em> method to split an array into two sub-arrays, one containing smaller elements and one containing larger elements than a given number. This means you 'sorted' half the array with respect to the other half. Can you repeatedly use <em>partition</em> to sort an entire array?</p>

<p><strong>Guideline</strong> <br>
In Insertion Sort, you simply went through each element in order and inserted it into a sorted sub-array. In this challenge, you cannot focus on one element at a time, but instead must deal with whole sub-arrays, with a strategy known as "divide and conquer".</p>

<p>When <em>partition</em> is called on an array, two parts of the array get 'sorted' with respect to each other. If <em>partition</em> is then called on each sub-array, the array will now be split into four parts. This process can be repeated until the sub-arrays are small. Notice that when partition is called on just one numbers, they end up being sorted.</p>

<p>Can you repeatedly call partition so that the entire array ends up sorted? </p>

<p><strong>Print Sub-Arrays</strong> <br>
In this challenge, print your array every time your partitioning method finishes, i.e. whenever two subarrays, along with the pivot, is merged together. </p>

<ul>
<li>The first element in a sub-array should be used as a pivot.</li>
<li>Partition the left side before partitioning the right side.</li>
<li>The pivot should be placed between sub-arrays while merging them.</li>
<li>Array of length $1$ or less will be considered sorted, and there is no need to sort or to print them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> <br>
Please maintain the original order of the elements in the left and right partitions while partitioning around a pivot element.</p>

<p>For example:
Partition about the first element for the array A[]={5, 8, 1, 3, 7, 9, 2}  will be {1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 7, 9}</p>

<p><strong>Input Format</strong> <br>
There will be two lines of input:</p>

<ul>
<li>$n$ - the size of the array</li>
<li>$ar$ - the <em>n</em> numbers of the array</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output Format</strong> <br>
Print every partitioned sub-array on a new line.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong> <br>
$1 \le n \le 1000$ <br>
$-1000 \le x \le 1000, x âˆˆ ar$ <br>
Each number is unique.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Input</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>7
5 8 1 3 7 9 2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Sample Output</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>2 3
1 2 3
7 8 9
1 2 3 5 7 8 9
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> <br>
This is a diagram of Quicksort operating on the sample array:</p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
The method <strong>quickSort</strong> takes in a parameter, $ar$, an unsorted array. Use the Quicksort algorithm to sort the entire array.</p></div></body></html>
