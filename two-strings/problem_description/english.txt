You are given two strings $A$ and $B$. Detect, whether there is a string that appears in the both $A$ and $B$.

**Input format:**

Several test cases will be given to you in a single file. The first line of the input will contain a single integer $T$ - the number of the test cases.

Then there will be $T$ descriptions of the test cases.
Each description consists of two lines. The first line contains the string $A$, the second line contains the string $B$.

**Output format:**

For each test case, output "YES", if there is a common substring and "NO" if there isn't any common substring of two strings.

**Example input:**

<pre>
2

</pre>

**Example output:**

<pre>YES
NO
</pre>

**Constraints:**

$1 <= T <= 10$<br>
$1 <= |A|, |B| <= 10^5$
