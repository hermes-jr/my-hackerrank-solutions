In this challenge, we practice solving problems based on the <em>Central Limit Theorem</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
A large elevator can transport a maximum of $9800$ pounds. Suppose a load of cargo containing $49$ boxes must be transported via the elevator. The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of $µ = 205$ pounds and a standard deviation of $σ = 15$ pounds. Based on this information, what is the probability that all $49$ boxes can be safely loaded onto the freight elevator and transported?</p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>Your output must be a floating point/decimal number, correct to a scale of $4$ decimal places. You can submit solutions in either of the $2$ following ways:   </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Solve the problem manually and submit your result as <em>Plain Text</em>. In the text box below, enter a single floating point/decimal number.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit an <em>R</em> or <em>Python</em> program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded), and computes the answer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>

<pre><code>0.1234
</code></pre>

<p>(This is <strong>NOT</strong> the answer, just a demonstration of the answering format.)   </p></div></body></html>
