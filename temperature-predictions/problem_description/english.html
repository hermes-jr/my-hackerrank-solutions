In this challenge, we practice predicting values. Check out the <a href="/contests/intro-to-statistics/challenges/temperature-predictions/resources">Resources</a> tab for some tips on approaching this problem.</p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
Given a record containing the maximum and minimum monthly temperatures at a particular station. The record shows the temperature information for each month in a data range from $\text{January 1908}$ to $\text{March 2012}$; however, some of the temperature values have been blanked out! Estimate and print the missing values.</p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Input Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>The first line contains an integer, $N$, denoting the number of rows of data in the input file. <br>
The second line contains the header for the tab-separated file; this line can be ignored, and is simply there to make the test case easier to read.<br>
The $N$ subsequent lines each describe the respective $year$, $month$, $\textit{maximum temperature}$, and $\textit{minimum temperature}$ data as a row of tab-separated values. In some of the rows, The $minimum$ or $maximum$ temperature field has been blanked out and replaced by: $\textit{Missing_1}$, $\textit{Missing_2}$, etc. </p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Constraints</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><ul>
<li>$1 \le N \le 1500$  </li>
<li>$1908 \le Year \le 2013$  </li>
<li>$-75 \le \textit{Maximum/Minimum Temperature} \le 75$</li>
<li>$\text{The } month \text{ field will always contain a fully spelled out month (January - December).}$</li>
<li>$\text{Data is provided for each month in chronological order. }$</li>
<li>$\text{Data may be missing for certain months or years.}$</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scoring</strong>  </p>

<p>The score seen upon hitting $\text{Run Code}$ is the score against the sample test case (of $444$ rows) only. It is normalized and will always lie between $0$ and $1$. <br>
Upon hitting $\text{Submit Code}$, the score seen is determined <em>solely on the basis of the hidden test case</em>.  </p>

<p><em>Details on the Scoring Formula</em>  </p>

<p>We compute the average of the magnitude of difference between your predicted value and the actual recorded value for each of the missing terms. If this average exceeds $5.0$ degrees, you will be assigned a score of zero.  </p>

<p>For each of the values predicted by you ($p$), we will compute an $error$. The $error$ is the difference of the predicted value ($p$) and the actual temperature at that location. Hence, <br>
$error = \lvert p - actualTemperatureRecording \rvert$ <br>
$M = \text{total missing values in the test case}$  </p>

<p>We will compute the <em>average</em> of all these error terms over all rows of data in the input file, and record it as $avg= \frac{\sum{errors}}{M}$</p>

<p>Your score for this challenge will be $(1- \frac{avg}{5.0}) \times (Max Score)$ <br>
Here, $MaxScore = \text{Total number of points assigned to this challenge}$.  </p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>Print each missing value on a new line.</p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><pre><code>20

<p>The above test case is for explanatory purposes only, which is why we included only $20$ lines. <br>
The sample test case, which is run upon hitting $\text{Run Code}$, has $444$ rows of data. <br>
The hidden test case, which is used at the time of submission, has over $1.2k$ rows of data. The sample test case rows are a subset of it.  </p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>The four missing values ($\textit{Missing_1}$, $\textit{Missing_2}$, $\textit{Missing_3}$, and $\textit{Missing_4}$) are:  </p>

<p>Your task is to predict values as close as possible to these.  </p></div></body></html>
