This is an introductory challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to give you a working I/O template in your preferred language. It includes scanning 2 integers from `STDIN`, calling a function, returning a value, and printing it to `STDOUT`.    

Your task is to scan two numbers from `STDIN`, and print the sum A+B on `STDOUT`. 

**Note**: The code has been saved in a template, which you can submit if you want. 

**Input Format**  
This section specifies the Input Format.  
Given _A_ and _B_ on two different lines.  

**Output Format**  
This section specifies the Output Format.  
An integer that denotes Sum _(A + B)_ 

**Constraints**  
This section tells what input you can expect. You can freely assume that the input will remain within the boundaries specified. As an example here given below, A and B will never be below 1 or above 1000.  
1 &le; _A_, _B_ &le; 1000

**Sample Input**  

	2
    3

**Sample Output**

	5
    
The above sample should be taken seriously. The input will be 2 and 3 in 2 separate lines. And output is just 1 number 5. If you print extra lines or "The answer is: 5" any such extra characters in output will result in a Wrong Answer. As the judging is done using diff checker.
