The purpose of this challenge is to familiarize you with reading input from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_.28stdin.29">stdin</a> (the standard input stream) and writing output to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29">stdout</a> (the standard output stream) using our environment.   </p>

<p>Review the code provided in the editor below, then complete the <em>solveMeFirst</em> function so that it returns the sum of two integers read from stdin. Take some time to understand this code so you're prepared to write it yourself in future challenges.</p>
