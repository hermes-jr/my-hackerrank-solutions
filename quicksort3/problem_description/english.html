It required copying the numbers into other arrays, which takes up  space and time. To make things faster, one can create an "in-place" version of Quicksort, where the numbers are all sorted within the array itself. </p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> <br>
Create an in-place version of Quicksort. You need to follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Algorithm">Lomuto Partitioning</a> method.  </p>

<p><strong>Guideline</strong> <br>
Instead of copying the array into multiple sub-arrays, use indices to keep track of the different sub-arrays. You can pass the indices to a modified <em>partition</em> method. The partition method should partition the sub-array and then return the index location where the pivot gets placed, so you can then call partition on each side of the pivot. </p>

<ul>
<li>Always select the <em>last</em> element in the 'sub-array' as a pivot. </li>
<li>Partition the left side and then the right side of the sub-array. </li>
<li>Print out the whole array at the end of every partitioning method.</li>
<li>An array of length $1$ or less will be considered sorted, and there is no need to sort or to print them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since you cannot just create new sub-arrays for the elements, partition method will need to use another trick to keep track of which elements are greater and which are lower than the pivot.</p>

<p><strong>The In-place Trick</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>If an element is lower than the pivot, you should swap it with a larger element on the left-side of the sub-array.</li>
<li>Greater elements should remain where they are.</li>
<li>At the end of the partitioning method, the pivot should be swapped with the first element of the right partition, consisting of all larger elements, of the sub-array.</li>
<li>To ensure that you don't swap a small element with another small element, use an index to keep track of the small elements that have already been swapped into their "place". </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Input Format</strong> <br>
There will be two lines of input:</p>

<ul>
<li>$n$ - the size of the array</li>
<li>$ar$ - the $n$ numbers of the array</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output Format</strong> <br>
Print the entire array on a new line at the end of every partitioning method. </p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong> <br>
$1 \le n \le 5000$ <br>
$-10000 \le x \le 10000, x âˆˆ ar$ <br>
There are no duplicate numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Input</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>7
1 3 9 8 2 7 5
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Sample Output</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>1 3 2 5 9 7 8
1 2 3 5 9 7 8
1 2 3 5 7 8 9
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> <br>
<em>5</em> is initally selected as the pivot, and the array is partitioned as shown in the diagram. The left side is partitioned next with <em>2</em> as the pivot. Finally, the right side is partitioned with <em>8</em> as the pivot. The entire array is now sorted. </p>
