Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list. Change the <code>next</code> pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

**Input Format**  
You have to complete the <code>Node* Reverse(Node* head)</code> method which takes one argument - the head of the linked list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

**Output Format**  
Change the <code>next</code> pointers of the nodes that their order is reversed and <code>return</code> the head of the reversed linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

**Sample Input**

NULL  
2 --> 3 --> NULL

**Sample Output**

    NULL
    3 --> 2 --> NULL

**Explanation**  
1. Empty list remains empty  
2. List is reversed from 2,3 to 3,2
