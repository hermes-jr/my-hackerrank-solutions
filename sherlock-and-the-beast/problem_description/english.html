Sherlock's companion, Dr. Watson, suggests Moriarty may be responsible for MI6's recent issues with their supercomputer, <em>The Beast</em>. </p>

<p>Shortly after resolving to investigate, Sherlock receives a note from Moriarty boasting about infecting <em>The Beast</em> with a virus; however, he also gives him a clue&mdash;a number, $N$. Sherlock determines the key to removing the virus is to find the largest <em>Decent Number</em> having $N$ digits.</p>

<p>A <em>Decent Number</em> has the following properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>Its digits can only be <em>3</em>'s and/or <em>5</em>'s.</li>
<li>The number of <em>3</em>'s it contains is divisible by <em>5</em>.</li>
<li>The number of <em>5</em>'s it contains is divisible by <em>3</em>.</li>
<li>If there are more than one such number, we pick the largest one. </li>
</ol>

<p>Moriarty's virus shows a clock counting down to <em>The Beast</em>'s destruction, and time is running out fast. Your task is to help Sherlock find the key before <em>The Beast</em> is destroyed!</p>

</code></pre></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Explanation</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>For $N = 1$, there is no decent number having $1$ digit (so we print $-1$).<br>
For $N = 3$, $555$ is the only possible number. The number $5$ appears three times in this number, so our count of $5$'s is evenly divisible by $3$ (<em>Decent Number Property 3</em>).<br>
For $N = 5$, $33333$ is the only possible number. The number $3$ appears five times in this number, so our count of $3$'s is evenly divisible by $5$ (<em>Decent Number Property 2</em>).<br>
For $N = 11$, $55555533333$ and all permutations of these digits are valid numbers; among them, the given number is the largest one.</p></div></body></html>
