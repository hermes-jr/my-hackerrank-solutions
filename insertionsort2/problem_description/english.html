<html></body><div class='msB'><p><strong></strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>In <em>Insertion Sort Part 1</em>, you sorted one element into an array. Using the same approach repeatedly, can you sort an entire unsorted array?</p>

<p><em>Guideline:</em> You already can place an element into a sorted array. How can you use that code to build up a sorted array, one element at a time? Note that in the first step, when you consider an element with just the first element - that is already "sorted" since there's nothing to its left that is smaller.</p>

<p>In this challenge, don't print every time you move an element. Instead, print the array after each iteration of the insertion-sort, i.e., whenever the next element is placed at its correct position.  </p>

<p>Since the array composed of just the first element is already "sorted", begin printing from the second element and on.</p>

<p><strong>Input Format</strong> <br>
There will be two lines of input:</p>

<ul>
<li>$s$ - the size of the array</li>
<li>$ar$ - a list of numbers that makes up the array</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output Format</strong> <br>
On each line, output the entire array at every iteration.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong> <br>
$1 \le s \le 1000$ <br>
$-10000 \le x \le 10000,  x âˆˆ ar$ </p>

<p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p>

<pre><code>6
1 4 3 5 6 2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p>

<pre><code>1 4 3 5 6 2 
1 3 4 5 6 2 
1 3 4 5 6 2 
1 3 4 5 6 2 
1 2 3 4 5 6 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> <br>
Insertion Sort checks $4$ first and doesn't need to move it, so it just prints out the array. Next, $3$ is inserted next to $1$, and the array is printed out. This continues one element at a time until the entire array is sorted.</p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
The method <strong>insertionSort</strong> takes in one parameter: $ar$, an unsorted array. Use an Insertion Sort Algorithm to sort the entire array.</p></div></body></html>
