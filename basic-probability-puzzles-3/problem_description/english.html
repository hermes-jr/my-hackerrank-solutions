In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
There are $3$ urns: $X$, $Y$ and $Z$. </p>

<ul>
<li>Urn $X$ contains $4$ red balls and $3$ black balls. </li>
<li>Urn $Y$ contains $5$ red balls and $4$ black balls. </li>
<li>Urn $Z$ contains $4$ red balls and $4$ black balls. </li>
</ul>

<p>One ball is drawn from each urn. What is the probability that the $3$ balls drawn consist of $2$ red balls and $1$ black ball?  </p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>In the editor below, submit your answer as <em>Plain Text</em> in the form of an irreducible fraction $A/B$, where $A$ and $B$ are both integers. </p>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>

<pre><code>3/4  
</code></pre>

<p>(This is <strong>NOT</strong> the answer, just a demonstration of the answer format.)</p></div></body></html>
