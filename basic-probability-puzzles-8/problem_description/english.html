In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
In a certain city, the probability of a resident <em>not</em> reading the <em>morning newspaper</em> is $\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of a resident <em>not</em> reading the <em>evening newspaper</em> is $\frac{2}{5}$. The probability they <em>will read both</em> newspapers is $\frac{1}{5}$. </p>

<p>Find the probability that a resident reads a newspaper (i.e.: the morning, evening, or both papers).</p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>In the editor below, submit your answer as <em>Plain Text</em> in the form of an irreducible fraction $A/B$, where $A$ and $B$ are both integers. </p>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>

<pre><code>3/4
