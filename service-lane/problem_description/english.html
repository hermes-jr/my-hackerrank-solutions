<html></body><div class='msB'><p><strong></strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>Calvin is driving his favorite vehicle on the 101 freeway. He notices that the check engine light of his vehicle is on, and he wants to service it immediately to avoid any risks. Luckily, a service lane runs parallel to the highway. The length of the service lane is $N$ units. The service lane consists of $N$ segments of equal length and different width.</p>

<p>Calvin can enter to and exit from any segment. Let's call the entry segment as index $i$ and the exit segment as index $j$. Assume that the exit segment lies after the entry segment ($i \le j$) and $0 \le i$. Calvin has to pass through <em>all</em> segments from index $i$ to index $j$ (both inclusive).</p>

<p><img src="https://hr-testcases.s3.amazonaws.com/1331" alt="Paradise Highway" title="" /></p>

<p>Calvin has three types of vehicles - bike, car, and truck - represented by $1$, $2$ and $3$, respectively. These numbers also denote the width of the vehicle.</p>

<p>You are given an array $width$ of length $N$, where $width[k]$ represents the width of the $k$<sup>th</sup> segment of the service lane. It is guaranteed that while servicing he can pass through at most $1000$ segments, including the entry and exit segments.</p>

<ul>
<li>If $width[k] = 1$, only the bike can pass through the $k$<sup>th</sup> segment.</li>
<li>If $width[k] = 2$, the bike and the car can pass through the $k$<sup>th</sup>  segment.</li>
<li>If $width[k] = 3$, all three vehicles can pass through the $k$<sup>th</sup> segment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the entry and exit point of Calvin's vehicle in the service lane, output the type of the largest vehicle which can pass through the service lane (including the entry and exit segments).</p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Input Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>The first line of input contains two integers, $N$ and $T$, where $N$ denotes the length of the freeway and $T$ the number of test cases. The next line has $N$ space-separated integers which represent the $width$ array.</p>

<p>$T$ test cases follow. Each test case contains two integers, $i$ and $j$, where $i$ is the index of the segment through which Calvin enters the service lane and $j$ is the index of the lane segment through which he exits.</p>

<ol>
<li>(0, 3): Because <em>width[2] = 1</em>, only the bike can pass through it.</li>
<li>(4, 6): Here the largest allowed vehicle which can pass through the 5<sup>th</sup> segment is the car and for the 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> segment it's the truck. Hence the largest vehicle allowed in these segments is a car.</li>
<li>(6, 7): In this example, the vehicle enters at the 6<sup>th</sup> segment and exits at the 7<sup>th</sup> segment. Both segments allow even trucks to pass through them. Hence the answer is <em>3</em>.</li>
<li>(3, 5): <em>width[3] = width[5] = 2</em>. While the 4<sup>th</sup> segment allows the truck, the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> allow up to a car. So <em>2</em> will be the answer here.</li>
<li>(0, 7): The bike is the only vehicle which can pass through the 2<sup>nd</sup> segment, which limits the strength of the whole lane to <em>1</em>.</li>
