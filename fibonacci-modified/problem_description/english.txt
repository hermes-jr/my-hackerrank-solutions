A series is defined in the following manner:

Given the n<sup>th</sup> and (n+1)<sup>th</sup> terms, the (n+2)<sup>th</sup> can be computed by the following relation  
**T<sub>n+2</sub> = (T<sub>n+1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + T<sub>n</sub>**      


So, if the first two terms of the series are 0 and 1:  
the third term = 1<sup>2</sup> + 0  = 1  
fourth term = 1<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2  
fifth term  = 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 5  
... And so on.  

Given three integers **A**, **B** and **N**, such that the first two terms of the series (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> terms) are **A** and **B** respectively, compute the N<sup>th</sup> term of the series.  

**Input Format**  

You are given three space separated integers **A, B and N** on one line.  

**Input Constraints**  
0 <= **A,B** <= 2  
3 <= **N** <= 20  

**Output Format**  

One integer.  
This integer is the **N<sup>th</sup>** term of the given series when the first two terms are **A** and **B** respectively.  

**Sample Input**  
    0 1 5  
    
**Sample Output**  
    5

**Explanation**  

The first two terms of the series are 0 and 1. The fifth term is 5. How we arrive at the fifth term, is explained step by step in the introductory sections.
