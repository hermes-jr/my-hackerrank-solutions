One common task for computers is to sort data. For example, people might want to see all their files on a computer sorted by size. Since sorting is a simple problem with many different possible solutions, it is often used to introduce the study of algorithms. </p>

<p><strong>Insertion Sort</strong> <br>
These challenges will cover <em>Insertion Sort</em>, a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. We will first start with an already sorted list.</p>

<p><strong>Insert element into sorted list</strong> <br>
Given a sorted list with an unsorted number $e$ in the rightmost cell, can you write some simple code to <em>insert</em> $e$ into the array so that it remains sorted?  </p>

<p>Print the array every time a value is shifted in the array until the array is fully sorted. The goal of this challenge is to follow the correct order of insertion sort. </p>

<p><em>Guideline:</em> You can copy the value of $e$ to a variable and consider its cell "empty". Since this leaves an extra cell empty on the right, you can shift everything over until $V$ can be inserted. This will create a duplicate of each value, but when you reach the right spot, you can replace it with $e$.  </p>

<p><strong>Input Format</strong> <br>
There will be two lines of input:</p>

<ul>
<li>$Size$ - the size of the array</li>
<li>$Arr$ - the unsorted array of integers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output Format</strong> <br>
On each line, output the entire array every time an item is shifted in it. </p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong> <br>
$1 \le Size  \le 1000$ <br>
$-10000 \le e \le 10000, e âˆˆ Arr$  </p>

<p><strong>Sample Input</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>5
2 4 6 8 3
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p>

<pre><code>2 4 6 8 8 
2 4 6 6 8 
2 4 4 6 8 
2 3 4 6 8 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

<p>$3$ is removed from the end of the array.<br/>
In the $1$<sup>st</sup> line $8 &gt; 3$, so $8$ is shifted one cell to the right. <br/>
In the $2$<sup>nd</sup> line $6 &gt; 3$, so $6$ is shifted one cell to the right. <br/>
In the $3$<sup>rd</sup> line $4 &gt; 3$, so $4$ is shifted one cell to the right. <br/>
In the $4$<sup>th</sup> line $2 &lt; 3$, so $3$ is placed at position $2$.  </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong>  </p>

<p>Complete the method <i>insertionSort</i> which takes in one parameter:</p>

<ul>
<li>$Arr$ - an array with the value $e$ in the right-most cell.  </li>
</ul>
