In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
A firm produces steel pipes in three plants.</p>

<ul>
<li>Plant $A$ produces $500$ units per day and has a fraction defective output of $0.005$.</li>
<li>Plant $B$ produces $1000$ units per day and has a fraction defective output of $0.008$.</li>
<li>Plant $C$ produces $2000$ units per day and has a fraction defective output of $0.010$. </li>
</ul>

<p>At random, a pipe is selected from the dayâ€™s total production and it is found to be defective. What is the probability that it came from plant $A$?  </p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>In the editor below, submit your answer as <em>Plain Text</em> in the form of an irreducible fraction $A/B$, where $A$ and $B$ are both integers. </p>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>

<pre><code>3/4  
</code></pre>

<p>(This is <strong>NOT</strong> the answer, just a demonstration of the answer format.)</p></div></body></html>
