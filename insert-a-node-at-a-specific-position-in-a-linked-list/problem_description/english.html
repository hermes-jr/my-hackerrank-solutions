<p>Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, an integer to add to the list and the position at which the integer must be inserted. Create a new node with the given integer, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node. A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.</p>

<p><strong>Input Format</strong> <br>
You have to complete the <code>Node* Insert(Node* head, int data, int position)</code> method which takes three arguments - the head of the linked list, the integer to insert and the position at which the integer must be inserted. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. <code>position</code> will always be between 0 and the number of the elements in the list (inclusive).</p>

<p><strong>Output Format</strong> <br>
Insert the new node at the desired position and <code>return</code> the head of the updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Input</strong>  </p>

<p>NULL,   data = 3, position = 0 <br>
3 --> NULL,  data = 4, position = 0</p>

<p><strong>Sample Output</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>3 --&gt; NULL
4 --&gt; 3 --&gt; NULL
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> <br>
1. we have an empty list and position 0. 3 becomes head. <br>
2. 4 is added to position 0, hence 4 becomes head. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> <br>
For the purpose of evaluation the list has been initialised with a node with data=2. Ignore it, this is done to avoid printing empty lists while comparing output. </p>
