In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> <br>
$Bag_1$ contains $4$ red balls and $5$ black balls. <br>
$Bag_2$ contains $3$ red balls and $7$ black balls. <br> </p>

<p>One ball is drawn from the $Bag_1$, and $2$ balls are drawn from $Bag_2$. Find the probability that $2$ balls are black and $1$ ball is red.  </p></div><div class='msB'><p><strong>Output Format</strong></p></div><div class='msB'><p>In the editor below, submit your answer as <em>Plain Text</em> in the form of an irreducible fraction $A/B$, where $A$ and $B$ are both integers. </p>

<p>Your answer should resemble something like:</p>
