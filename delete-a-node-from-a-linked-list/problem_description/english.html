<p>Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and the position of a node to delete. Delete the node at the given position and return the head node. A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The list may become empty after you delete the node.</p>

<p><strong>Input Format</strong> <br>
You have to complete the <code>Node* Delete(Node* head, int position)</code> method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node to delete. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. <code>position</code> will always be at least 0 and less than the number of the elements in the list.</p>

<p><strong>Output Format</strong> <br>
Delete the node at the given position and <code>return</code> the head of the updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p>

<p>1 --> 2 --> 3 --> NULL,  position =  0 <br>
1 --> NULL ,  position = 0</p>

<p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p>

<pre><code>2 --&gt; 3 --&gt; NULL
NULL
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> <br>
1. 0th position is removed, 1 is deleted from the list. <br>
2. Again 0th position is deleted and we are left with empty list. </p>
